Welcome to My Commute! https://robbiesanchez.github.io/my-commute/#/

My Commute is an app designed to help people search for podcasts that they can finish during their daily commute. 

I thought of this idea after turning from a long commuter to a short commuter. I used to have no trouble finding podcasts I could listen to in their entirety during my commute. Once my commute shortened up, I was having a hard time finding some shorter episodes.

My Commute returns a list of the top podcasts for any particular genre, allows the user to pick one of those podcasts then filter for episodes that they can finish during their daily commute.

The site was developed using JavaScript, React.js, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, listen notes API, and a Kanye API (for some entertainment)
